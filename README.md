# Bioinformatician


## Education
- MS, Bioinformatics | Northeastern University (_May 2024_)
- B.E., Biotechnology | Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering (_Aug 2021_)


## Work Experience
**Human Genetics and Genomics Co-op @ Editas Medicine (_Jan 2024 - Present_)**
- I accelerate the identification of potential therapeutic targets by developing and deploying bioinformatics tools that automate the ingestion, extraction, and analysis of omics data from curated databases like ENCODE.
- In my work with gene editing therapeutic programs, I support the formulation and execution of innovative research strategies in target discovery under the human genetics team.
- I enhance data interpretation and decision-making by leading the creation of advanced visualization techniques, significantly improving target identification and validation processes for other technical teams.

**Programmer Analyst Trainee @ Cognizant (_Mar 2021 - Jul 2022_)**
- I spearheaded the strategic transition from DB2 to Oracle databases, optimizing Maven dependencies tailored for Spring frameworks, resulting in a 25% increase in operational efficiency.
- I enhanced application performance by 30% and significantly improve user experience by successfully integrating critical production changes on Linux servers and creating thorough project documentation. I also co-lead a team to create an Event Management application and a Student Details Management web application with C# and CodeFirst Entity Framework, fostering teamwork and efficiency.

**Research Student Intern @ RV College of Engineering (_Aug 2020 - Sep 2020_)**
- I developed an automated way of identifiying protein domain clusters using Python aiding in faster analysis, for on-going projects.
- This project directly contributed to post-doctoral research by helping provide highly accurate way of identifying protein domain identification, contributing to significant operational efficiency.

## Academic Projects and Awards
**In-Silico Studies of HFE and HJV Genes involved in Hereditary Hemochromatosis (_Mar 2020_)**
- Analyzed major mutations in the genes HJV and HFE contributing to Hereditary Hemochromatosis and identified the most disease-contributing variants
- Utilized computational tools and GROMACS software suite, performing molecular dynamics simulations for structural analysis of gene products

Awarded **Best Poster Presentation Award** for the project at the International Conference for Novel Approach of Biotechnology and Bioengineering in Health care Systems, sponsored by AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education)
